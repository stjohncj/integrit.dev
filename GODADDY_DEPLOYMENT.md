## Prerequisites

### Method 1: Using File Manager (Recommended)

1. **Log into your GoDaddy account**

   - Delete any existing files if this is a fresh setup

4. **Upload your site files**
   - Upload ALL files from the `dist/` folder to `public_html/`
   - Your file structure should look like:

     ```

### Method 2: Using FTP

1. **Get FTP credentials**
   - In cPanel, look for "FTP Accounts" or "FTP Access"
   - Use your main account or create a new FTP user

2. **Connect with FTP client**
   - Use FileZilla, WinSCP, or similar FTP client
   - Host: Your domain or server IP
   - Username: Your FTP username
   - Password: Your FTP password

3. **Upload files**
   - Navigate to `/public_html/` on the remote server
   - Upload all contents from your local `dist/` folder

## Files to Upload

Upload these files from your `dist/` directory:

```
âœ… index.html          (Main website file)
âœ… robots.txt          (SEO - search engine instructions)
âœ… sitemap.xml         (SEO - site structure)

   â””â”€â”€ logo-C4fsJfY2.svg
```

## Domain Configuration

### If using integrit.dev domain:

1. **Update DNS Settings**
   - In GoDaddy Domain Manager, point your domain to your hosting
